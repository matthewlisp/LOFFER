I'm a [**web developer**](github) and i love lisp, mostly *Clojure*, and i love learning stuff and teaching people as much as i can.<br/>

I've created this website to share and [**blog**](link) everything i learned and give a little back to the community.<br/>

You'll also find here some [**guides**](link) i've made to teach clojure stuff for anyone interested and my personal [**projects**](link).<br/>

TODO: Add guides i've made to teach clojure.
