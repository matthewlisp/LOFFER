### My website is still under construction! 

I'm a [**web developer**](https://github.com/matthewlisp) and i love lisp, mostly *Clojure*. Learning stuff and teaching people as much as i can is my hobby.<br/>

I've created this website to share and [**blog**](http://matthewlisp.com/tags/) everything i learned and give a little back to the community.<br/>

You'll also find here some [**guides**](http://matthewlisp.com/learn/) i've made to teach clojure stuff for anyone interested and my personal [**projects**](#).<br/>
