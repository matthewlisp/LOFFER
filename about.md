### Who am i
As everyone, i'm still trying to figure out this answer but for now, i'm Matthew, a self-taught web developer currently living in Brazil, big fan of open source world and the Clojure language.

### My journey into programming
I started my journey around 3 years ago *(January of 2017)*, simply because i had a lot of interest in learning more about tech. Deeply fell in love with programming specially for the web. <br/>

In 2018 i discovered functional programming and Lisp by reading[ HTDP](https://htdp.org/2019-02-24/). I had found a language that i loved and i was excited to use it professionally, turns out that the practical modern lisp was: **Clojure**!

This year (2019) i dedicated full time to learn clojure and back-end for the web.

I'm here to share my knowledge and my journey with everyone!
